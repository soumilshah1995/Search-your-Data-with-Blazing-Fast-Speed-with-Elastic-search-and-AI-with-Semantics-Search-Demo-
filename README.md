###### multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1
* This is a sentence-transformers model: It maps sentences & paragraphs to a 384 dimensional dense vector space and was designed for semantic search. It has been trained on 215M (question, answer) pairs from diverse sources. For an introduction to semantic search, have a look at: SBERT.net - Semantic Search
